> This project aims to investigate whether Zipf’s Law of Abbreviation holds for a particular genre of text in different languages. We used Shakespeare's Sonnets in English and French, obtained from Project Gutenberg. We used spaCy to process the text and visualized the correlation between word frequency and length.
