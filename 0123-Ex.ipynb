Nowadays at most of the smart restaurants\\r\\nvegetable and cereal dishes are a feature of almost every meal, and at\\r\\nprivate houses no luncheon and few dinner menus are considered complete\\r\\nunless a vegetable or cereal dish is included.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut apart from fashion the value of these dishes is great; they are\\r\\ngood for the health and good for the pocket of the housekeeper,\\r\\nprovided they are ordered with discretion.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the country, where vegetables are plentiful and money is not, I have\\r\\noften noticed that sufficient use is not made of vegetables, while\\r\\nwhere fresh green food is a luxury its place is not taken--as it should\\r\\nbe--by such food stuffs as rice, macaroni, haricot beans and corn.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the housekeeper whose weekly income is limited knows only too well,\\r\\nthere often comes a day when the supply of meat falls short. Then\\r\\ncomes the question, can it be eked out in a presentable manner or\\r\\nmust more be bought and the desired cost exceeded. Now the woman who\\r\\ncaters carefully will realize how such inexpensive materials as rice or\\r\\nmacaroni, potatoes or cabbage may be pressed into service.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor example, the only available meat dish for luncheon is a hot pot of\\r\\nmutton and the party is suddenly augmented. Add to the menu a dish of\\r\\nmacaroni au jus, or a rissole or corn curry, and supplement the homely\\r\\npudding with a little cheese savoury, and what more can any one desire?\\r\\n\\r\\nThen if the meat for a veal and ham pie is scarcely sufficient add a\\r\\nliberal quantity of partly cooked macaroni cut into short lengths,\\r\\nwhile should the quantity of minced mutton available seem sadly little,\\r\\nadd an ample border of savoury rice or an extra dish of potato and\\r\\ncheese balls. If rissoles are required add to them by means of mashed\\r\\npotato or rice.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen never allow small quantities of cooked vegetables left over from\\r\\nlunch or dinner to be thrown away. Place them on clean plates in the\\r\\nlarder; they will prove useful additions to the next day’s bill of fare.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor example, you have two or three young carrots, a cupful of peas,\\r\\neven a smaller quantity of broad beans. Slice the carrots and arrange\\r\\nall three vegetables in china shells, mask with mayonnaise sauce,\\r\\nsprinkle with coralline pepper, and serve with cold meat, or reheat\\r\\nthem by steaming, place them in a hot fireproof dish, cover with\\r\\nboiling hot maître d’hôtel sauce, and garnish with rolls of bacon, and\\r\\nserve as a luncheon dish; or add a little onion and use for a vegetable\\r\\ncurry, and serve surrounded by well-boiled rice; or reheat, mix with\\r\\nparsley and butter sauce, cover with mashed potato, score the top and\\r\\nbrown in the oven, and serve for luncheon in the guise of vegetable pie.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf some new potatoes are left over, slice, fry, and serve with or\\r\\nwithout bacon for breakfast; while should you have some old boiled\\r\\npotatoes to use up they may be mashed and employed in half a score of\\r\\nways; incorporated with cabbage, pepper, salt, and a little butter,\\r\\nformed into cakes, and fried to serve with bacon, grilled chicken or\\r\\nham, for instance.\\r\\n\\r\\nThus the clever housekeeper economizes and yet does not allow her\\r\\neconomies to be apparent.\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore passing on to the recipes which are the _raison d’être_ of this\\r\\nlittle volume, I would say a word on the treatment of vegetables.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is the habit of gardeners to pick fruit, vegetables, etc., in the\\r\\nmorning, and to bring in the day’s supply at about eleven o’clock, and\\r\\non Saturday to provide sufficient for two days’ consumption. Except\\r\\nin the case of strawberries (which should be gathered, if possible,\\r\\non the day on which they are to be eaten) and asparagus (which is\\r\\ninfinitely better when cut just before the time for cooking), there is\\r\\nno objection to this plan, provided the garden produce is stored in the\\r\\nbest manner. Carrots and turnips, leeks and onions should be placed\\r\\nin wire racks; and lettuces should be arranged root-end downmost in a\\r\\nshallow pan of fresh water. Cabbages and cauliflower may be treated\\r\\nlikewise. Parsley should be placed in water as if it were a flower--not\\r\\nsoused head over heels in that liquid. Whether the stalk-end of a\\r\\ncucumber should be placed in water, or whether the vegetable should\\r\\nbe left dry in a cool, airy place, is a moot point. I do not feel\\r\\ncompetent to say which course should be followed, but my cook, who\\r\\nis clever at cooking vegetables, opines that cucumbers should not be\\r\\nplaced in water; and, in any case, that they should not be kept long\\r\\nwhen cut.\\r\\n\\r\\nMustard-and-cress should be arranged in a shallow pan of water.\\r\\n\\r\\nPeas and broad beans should not be shelled unnecessarily long before\\r\\neating, and if it is necessary to keep them they should be placed in a\\r\\nwire rack in a cool, well-ventilated place.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll vegetables should be eaten while young, or they lose considerably\\r\\nin flavour. When French or runner beans are quite young it is better\\r\\nmerely to remove the strings and to cook them whole; but when old age\\r\\napproaches they are more palatable when sliced.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTo Boil Vegetables\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen boiling vegetables remember that all fresh vegetables should\\r\\nbe plunged into boiling salted water, the proportions being 1\\r\\ntablespoonful of salt to 1 gallon of water.\\r\\n\\r\\nDried vegetables should be placed in lukewarm water.\\r\\n\\r\\nA piece of sugar put into the water in which green vegetables are\\r\\ncooked helps to bring out the flavour.\\r\\n\\r\\nLeave the cover off the pan in which vegetables are cooked, or, at all\\r\\nevents, leave it half off, so that the steam can escape easily.\\r\\n\\r\\nDo not allow vegetables to stay in the water in which they are boiled,\\r\\nbut drain them at once, pressing out all the water possible.\\r\\n\\r\\nGreen vegetables take on an average about 20 minutes to cook, though 10\\r\\nminutes is often long enough for young peas, while cabbages sometimes\\r\\ntake nearly an hour.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe best way of cooking peas is as follows:--Shell a pint of peas and\\r\\nplace them in a jar with a closely-fitting lid, put in with them a\\r\\nsaltspoonful of salt, a tablespoonful of butter, a teaspoonful of\\r\\npowdered white sugar, a sprig of mint and a shake of black pepper.\\r\\nCover the jar closely and place it in a saucepan of boiling water. Boil\\r\\nbriskly, until done, which should be in ½ an hour to ¾ of an hour.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPeas with Béchamel Sauce (Hot)\\r\\n\\r\\nCook the peas as in the preceding recipe, and just before serving pour\\r\\nover them a small quantity of Béchamel sauce.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPetit Pois au Beurre (Hot)\\r\\n\\r\\n_Peas with Butter_\\r\\n\\r\\nHaving cooked the peas either by the method described above or having\\r\\nboiled them in the ordinary way, drain off the water and shake the peas\\r\\nto dry them well, return them to the hot dry pan they were cooked in,\\r\\nand at the last moment before serving throw in a pat of butter, let\\r\\nthis just melt, and serve.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFrench Beans\\r\\n\\r\\n_À la Crême de Fromage_ (_Hot_)\\r\\n\\r\\nCook the beans in the usual way by throwing them in boiling salted\\r\\nwater in which a teaspoonful of sugar has been placed. If young, cook\\r\\nthem whole, only removing the spines and pointed end, or if stock can\\r\\nbe used, place them in a pan which has been buttered, sprinkle them\\r\\nwith salt, and just cover them with stock. When tender place them on a\\r\\nhot dish, make a white sauce with ½ oz. of butter and ½ oz. of flour\\r\\nmixed with ½ pint of the stock in which the beans have been cooked, add\\r\\na good pinch of salt and stir well, adding one well-beaten egg and two\\r\\ntablespoonsful of finely-grated cheese. Do not let the sauce boil after\\r\\nthe egg has been added or it will curdle. Pour round the beans and\\r\\nserve.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrench beans can also be served with Béchamel sauce or quite plainly\\r\\nwith a small quantity of butter melted and run over them, with a shake\\r\\nof pepper and salt, or again with a plain melted butter sauce.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFlageolets\\r\\n\\r\\nFlageolets are the beans of the kidney bean, French bean, etc., and\\r\\nwhen shelled and cooked in various ways are excellent eating. They\\r\\nshould be boiled in the same way as peas, simply omitting the sprig of\\r\\nmint, and can be served in various ways.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFlageolets au Beurre (Hot)\\r\\n\\r\\nHaving boiled and drained the beans, place a pat of butter in the\\r\\nsaucepan just before serving.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFlageolets au Maître d’Hôtel (Hot)\\r\\n\\r\\nMake a butter by mixing 1 oz. of butter, the juice of ½ a lemon, a\\r\\nteaspoonful of chopped parsley, a pinch of salt and pepper, mix well\\r\\nand form into a pat. When the beans are cooked and drained, place this\\r\\nwith them, shake and serve.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFlageolets à la Crême de Fromage (Hot)\\r\\n\\r\\n(_With Cheese Sauce_)\\r\\n\\r\\nFollow the directions for French beans, substituting flageolets, and\\r\\nboiling in the ordinary way.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCabbage with Cheese Sauce (Hot)\\r\\n\\r\\nBoil a cabbage, cut it in 8 pieces, then place it in 1 pint of cheese\\r\\nsauce, make it thoroughly hot, and serve with the sauce poured over it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCabbage à la Crême (Hot)\\r\\n\\r\\nDrain a boiled cabbage, cut it up small, put it into a saucepan with\\r\\n1 oz. of butter, 1 gill of cream, and a seasoning of pepper and salt,\\r\\nstir it all together over the fire till thoroughly hot, then turn it\\r\\nout on to a hot dish, and serve with fried croûtons.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBrussels-Sprouts\\r\\n\\r\\ncan be served in various ways. For au beurre after boiling, drain well,\\r\\ntaking great care to squeeze every drop of water possible from the\\r\\nsprouts, return to the pan and toss in butter, and dust with pepper and\\r\\nsalt.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBrussels-Sprouts à la Maître d’Hôtel (Hot)\\r\\n\\r\\nFollow the above recipe, substituting maître d’hôtel butter for\\r\\nordinary butter.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBrussels-Sprouts au Jus (Hot) with Stock\\r\\n\\r\\nBlanch the sprouts, by dipping them in boiling water and letting them\\r\\nremain in it for a few minutes. Remove them and drain well, placing\\r\\nthem in a pan with just enough stock to cover them. Simmer until\\r\\ntender, drain and serve.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBoiled Nettles (Hot)\\r\\n\\r\\nChoose very young nettles, and wash them well in two or three waters;\\r\\nchop them up very fine, and put them into a stewpan with a little\\r\\nwater, and steam until quite tender. Meanwhile toast as many slices of\\r\\nbread as required, trim these neatly, lay them on a hot dish, drain the\\r\\nnettles well, serve on the hot toast, dusted with pepper and salt, and\\r\\nserve with a beurre fondue sauce, made as follows:--Put 2 oz. of butter\\r\\ninto a clean saucepan with ½ a teaspoonful of salt, and half as much\\r\\npepper, and 1 dessertspoonful of lemon juice; stir these all together\\r\\nover the fire until half melted, take it off the fire and continue\\r\\nstirring until the butter is all dissolved.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nStewed Nettles (Hot)\\r\\n\\r\\nWash the shoots and young leaves of nettles very thoroughly in slightly\\r\\nsalted water, dry well and mince very finely. Put this into a stewpan\\r\\nwith 1 tablespoonful of finely-chopped onion, a suspicion of brown\\r\\nsugar, season with pepper and salt to taste, pour in a little stock or\\r\\nwater, and stew gently at the side of the fire until quite tender; then\\r\\nmix together 1 oz. of butter and 1 teaspoonful of salt, till perfectly\\r\\nsmooth, add this to the nettles, with ½ a tablespoonful of thick cream\\r\\nor new milk, stir it all well together till quite hot, and serve on\\r\\nslices of hot toast. If liked, the onion may be omitted, when the\\r\\nnettles are treated exactly like spinach.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPurée of Watercress (Hot)\\r\\n\\r\\nWash some watercress well, getting rid of all faded or discoloured\\r\\nparts, then put it on in plenty of boiling salted water, and boil it\\r\\ntill almost cooked; lift it out, and drain on a sieve or colander to\\r\\nget rid of as much water as possible. Meanwhile melt about 1½oz. of\\r\\nbutter in a pan, put the watercress on in this, sprinkle it lightly\\r\\nwith flour, and stir it all together over the fire for about 10\\r\\nminutes, then add about 2 gills of good stock, season with pepper\\r\\nand salt; cook it for 10 minutes longer, stirring it continuously,\\r\\nrub it through a sieve and serve very hot, garnished with quartered\\r\\nhard-boiled eggs, and fried croûtons.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nStewed Lettuce\\r\\n\\r\\nTreat exactly as in the previous recipe.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPurée of Turnip Tops\\r\\n\\r\\nProceed as for watercress or lettuce.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCauliflower with Tomato Sauce (Hot)\\r\\n\\r\\nClean and soak the cauliflower in salt and water for 1 hour, then\\r\\nplunge it into boiling water, returning it again to cold water. After\\r\\nthis put it in a pan of boiling water slightly salted (½ oz. of salt to\\r\\n1 gallon of water) and boil it until tender, 20 to 25 minutes. In the\\r\\nmeantime make ½ pint of tomato purée by the following recipe, and when\\r\\nthe cauliflower is cooked place it on a hot dish, pour the purée over\\r\\nit, sift some finely-grated brown crumbs over it and serve.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTomato Purée\\r\\n\\r\\nSix smallish tomatoes. Cut them into slices and place them in an\\r\\nenamelled saucepan, add 1 oz. of butter, a teaspoonful of chopped\\r\\nparsley, salt, pepper, and a tiny pinch of cayenne. Pour over one pint\\r\\nof stock. Boil until quite soft, and then pass through a sieve, add\\r\\n1 oz. of anchovy essence, thicken with ½ oz. of butter and ½ oz. of\\r\\nflour previously mixed together in another pan with some of the tomato\\r\\nmixture. Stir over the fire until the sauce thickens, and it is then\\r\\nready for use.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCauliflower Fritters (Hot)\\r\\n\\r\\nBreak a cooked cauliflower up into neat pieces, dip these in frying\\r\\nbatter till well covered, and fry in boiling fat. Drain them well,\\r\\nsprinkle with grated Parmesan cheese and coralline pepper. Serve at\\r\\nonce on a napkin.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is an excellent way of serving cauliflower which has been left\\r\\nover.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCauliflower au Gratin\\r\\n\\r\\nBoil the cauliflower as before, place it in a fireproof dish, pour over\\r\\nit an ample quantity of cheese sauce, sprinkle with grated cheese and\\r\\nbrown crumbs and bake until slightly brown on the top. For cheese sauce\\r\\nsee the recipe for French beans à la crême de fromage (page 12).\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCauliflower with Soubise Sauce\\r\\n\\r\\nBoil the cauliflower, place in a fireproof dish. Cover with delicate\\r\\nonion sauce (Soubise sauce, p. 47), sprinkle with brown crumbs and make\\r\\nvery hot in the oven.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSpinach Patties (Hot)\\r\\n\\r\\nTake 1 lb. of spinach leaves, pick and wash them well, and after this\\r\\nblanch them by plunging them for 5 or 6 minutes in boiling water, drain\\r\\nthem and place them in cold water, remove, press, and strain, to get\\r\\nrid of as much moisture as possible. Chop them up, place in a stewpan a\\r\\npinch of salt and sugar, ½ oz. of butter and ¼ oz. of flour, and after\\r\\nstirring this for a few minutes add the spinach. Stir for 5 minutes\\r\\nthen add ¼ pint of milk, stir for a few minutes longer, and then add\\r\\n½ pint of milk, stirring steadily until the liquid is almost dried\\r\\nup. Remove from the pan and pass through a sieve, then return to the\\r\\nfire and add a small pat of butter and keep very hot. Have ready the\\r\\nrequired number of pastry patty cases. Quickly make some buttered egg,\\r\\nplace some of the spinach in each case, with a spoonful of buttered egg\\r\\non the top, and serve at once very hot.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSpinach and Tomatoes (Hot)\\r\\n\\r\\nPrepare the spinach as in the preceding recipe. Bake six small\\r\\ntomatoes carefully in the oven with a piece of butter on each. When\\r\\nready arrange the spinach in a dish in the form of a border, place the\\r\\ntomatoes in the centre and serve.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nÉpinards (Spinach) à la Crême (Hot)\\r\\n\\r\\nWash the spinach in six or seven waters, so as to prevent its being\\r\\ngritty; put it in a saucepan on the fire, with a very little water and\\r\\nsalt; when done strain very dry and chop it up very fine. Warm 2 oz. of\\r\\nbutter in a stewpan, put the spinach in, stir till the moisture quite\\r\\nevaporates, then add a very little salt, a tiny pinch of sugar (a very\\r\\nlittle nutmeg, if liked), a pinch of flour, and 1 large tablespoonful\\r\\nof cream, and let the whole simmer for a quarter of an hour. Then put\\r\\nthrough a sieve and keep hot. In the meantime, fry in fat some bread\\r\\ncut into fingers, about 2½ in. long and ½ in. square, and plant them in\\r\\nlittle rows all over the spinach when dished.\\r\\n\\r\\nSpinach cooked thus is delicious and a very different matter from the\\r\\nstringy green mass generally served.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTurnip Tops à la Crême\\r\\n\\r\\nCook as in the previous recipe for spinach.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlmost any greens, including cabbage and Brussels-sprouts, are\\r\\nexcellent when served thus.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAsparagus.\\r\\n\\r\\nAsparagus is really almost at its best served plain boiled with oiled\\r\\nbutter; but when it first comes in, the big kind, which is best for\\r\\nboiling, is rather expensive, and few people seem to know how good the\\r\\nmore “grasslike” kind is if treated properly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBoiled Asparagus (Hot)\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough every one will at once say they know how asparagus should be\\r\\nboiled, yet it is a melancholy fact that it is not by any means an\\r\\ninvariable rule to find this vegetable properly treated. If, however,\\r\\nthe following directions are carried out the result is certainly worth\\r\\nthe little extra trouble. Cut the stalks of a bundle of fresh asparagus\\r\\nevenly and tie them up into a bunch, put them upright into a pan just\\r\\nlarge enough to hold them comfortably and with boiling water to within\\r\\nabout 3 in. of the tops. Keep them on the fire for from 30 to 40\\r\\nminutes, then lift them out, drain well, remove the string, and dish\\r\\nthem on a neatly folded napkin or square of toast. Treated in this way,\\r\\nthe heads are not so apt to come off, and the stalks, instead of being\\r\\ntough, are quite tender and eatable. Excellent asparagus cookers are\\r\\nnow made, but if one of these is not to hand its lack will not be felt\\r\\nif the instructions already given are observed. Asparagus should be\\r\\nserved with\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPlain Oiled Butter, or Beurre Fondu,\\r\\n\\r\\nwhich is made as follows:--Put 2 oz. of fresh butter into a pan with 1\\r\\nsaltspoonful of salt, ½ a saltspoonful of pepper, and ½ a tablespoonful\\r\\nof lemon juice; stir this over the fire with a clean wooden spoon till\\r\\nthe butter has rather more than half melted; then lift it off the fire,\\r\\nand continue the stirring until the butter is entirely melted, when\\r\\nit will have a creamy taste, quite different from the ordinary oiled\\r\\nbutter.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAsparagus au Jus (Hot)\\r\\n\\r\\nCut the young, green, small asparagus diagonally into equal lengths\\r\\n(like French beans), and toss these lightly in bacon fat; when slightly\\r\\ncrisped, season with white pepper, salt, minced parsley, and chervil,\\r\\nand add a little stock; simmer gently till cooked. Now add a spoonful\\r\\nor so of good beef or mutton gravy, and serve. The great secret of this\\r\\ndish is only to put in enough stock in the first instance to cook the\\r\\nasparagus, for it should all be absorbed by the time you add the gravy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAsparagus Sprue à la Pompadour (Hot)\\r\\n\\r\\nSteam the sprue, or small asparagus, in boiling salted water (_see_\\r\\np. 21), cut into lengths as above, and let them dry in a well-heated\\r\\nnapkin, in a warm place, to keep hot. Meanwhile stir together some\\r\\nfresh butter, the yolk of 1 or more eggs, a spoonful of vinegar, a dust\\r\\nof salt, and some freshly-ground black pepper; stand the pan containing\\r\\nthis in another pan half-full of boiling water, and stir it over the\\r\\nfire till thoroughly blended. Place the asparagus in the dish, pour the\\r\\nsauce over it, and serve.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIced Asparagus\\r\\n\\r\\nFor this the large asparagus is required. When cooked lay on ice\\r\\nor keep in an ice cave. Serve in an entrée dish and hand very cold\\r\\nmayonnaise sauce.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER II\\r\\n\\r\\nVEGETABLE DISHES\\r\\n\\r\\n(_Continued_)\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPotatoes\\r\\n\\r\\nA favourite kitchen superstition is that which forbids the use of\\r\\nleft-over potatoes. For many dishes cooked potato is required. Why then\\r\\ncook fresh potatoes for the purpose and thereby waste time and money?\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sensible cook keeps all left-over potato, and makes use of it in\\r\\nsome of the ways here described.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPotato Croquettes (Hot)\\r\\n\\r\\nTake 1 lb. of cold cooked potato and place in a mortar. Mash it until\\r\\nall the lumps have disappeared, add a pat of butter and enough milk or\\r\\ncream to make the potato soft, and of the right consistency to form\\r\\ninto balls, add a tablespoonful of chopped parsley, a very small\\r\\nquantity of chives (if liked), mix well and form into balls. Coat them\\r\\nwith egg, roll them in finely-grated breadcrumbs, fry a golden brown,\\r\\ndrain and serve.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPotatoes à la Crême (Hot)\\r\\n\\r\\nHaving washed and peeled the number of potatoes required, cut them into\\r\\nvery thin slices and as much the same size as possible. Place them in\\r\\ncold water for ½ hour, then drain them and dry on a soft clean cloth.\\r\\nHave ready a fireproof dish with a closely-fitting lid, butter the\\r\\nbottom and sides of it, and place a layer of potatoes in it, laying\\r\\nthem to overlap each other, and also to stand round the sides, place on\\r\\nthese a layer of soft butter, and a sprinkling of salt, and continue in\\r\\nthis way until the dish is full, ending with a layer of butter. Place\\r\\nthe lid on firmly, and place the dish in a moderate (350 deg.) oven for\\r\\n¾ of an hour.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCheese Potatoes (Hot)\\r\\n\\r\\nFollow the previous recipe, the only difference being that grated\\r\\ncheese should be sprinkled between each layer of potato in addition to\\r\\nthe butter.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPotatoes à la Crême (Hot)\\r\\n\\r\\n(_A Method of Using up left-over new Potatoes_)\\r\\n\\r\\nPut into a pan from ½ to 1 oz. of butter, add a good dessertspoonful\\r\\nof flour, some parsley and minced chives, with salt, pepper, and a\\r\\ndust of nutmeg to taste; when the whole is smoothly blended, pour in\\r\\nsufficient single cream or new milk, and stir it all together till it\\r\\nboils up, then add as many cold, cooked new potatoes as you want, and\\r\\nallow them to heat thoroughly in the sauce without actually boiling,\\r\\nwhich would break them; serve with a dust of coralline pepper.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPotatoes au Gratin (Hot)\\r\\n\\r\\nWell butter a gratin dish, and dust it liberally with minced parsley,\\r\\nwhite and coralline pepper, and, if liked, a little grated Parmesan;\\r\\ncover this with a layer of thinly sliced, cold, cooked new potatoes,\\r\\nmoistening them as you do so with a little cream, milk, or, failing\\r\\neither of these, a little oiled butter, dusting the whole with minced\\r\\nparsley, pepper, salt, and a very little cheese; repeat these layers\\r\\ntill the dish is full, finishing with a very light sprinkling of fine\\r\\nwhite breadcrumbs, a little spice, grated cheese, and, lastly, some\\r\\ntiny morsels of fresh butter, and bake till the surface is nicely\\r\\ncovered.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPotato and Cabbage Cakes\\r\\n\\r\\nTake any cold potato and cabbage, mash it smoothly together, adding\\r\\nbeaten egg, white sauce, or melted butter to moisten. Flavour rather\\r\\nhighly with pepper, add a little salt. Form into round cakes, flour,\\r\\nand bake or fry.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCurried Potato Cakes\\r\\n\\r\\nHave ready some curry sauce with which to moisten the mashed potato,\\r\\nand proceed as before.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPotato Cromeskies (with Mushroom)\\r\\n\\r\\nHave ready some well-flavoured mushrooms stewed in white sauce (the\\r\\nmushrooms cut into small pieces). Make some smoothed mashed potato and\\r\\nadd to it a beaten yolk of egg. Form balls of the potato. Hollow out a\\r\\nplace in each, fill with the mushroom mixture. Cover with more potato,\\r\\negg, crumb, fry and serve very hot.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPotato Mould (Hot)\\r\\n\\r\\nMash 1 lb. of well-boiled potatoes with the same quantity of boiled\\r\\nmashed carrot, pass through a fine wire sieve, mix all well together\\r\\nwith warm milk, and a lump of butter; place in a buttered mould, and\\r\\nset in a hot oven for 10 minutes, turn out on a hot dish, and brown in\\r\\nthe oven.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nArtichokes au Gratin (Hot)\\r\\n\\r\\nWash and peel the artichokes and place them in cold salted water, then\\r\\nput them in a pan full of boiling salted water. Boil for 20 minutes.\\r\\n(If the artichokes are old they should be put into cold water, which\\r\\nmust be brought to the boil and kept so until they are cooked.) Take\\r\\nthe artichokes out and drain them, cut into pieces, then place them\\r\\nin a fireproof dish, covering them with a good white sauce. Sprinkle\\r\\nwith grated cheese. Place in a moderate oven, and bake about 10 to 15\\r\\nminutes until of a golden brown.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nScalloped Artichokes\\r\\n\\r\\nCook as in the previous recipe, but omit the cheese and bake in shells\\r\\nwhich have been buttered and sprinkled with brown crumbs. Sprinkle the\\r\\nartichoke mixture with crumbs also, place a little butter on the top\\r\\nand brown as before.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nArtichoke Soufflé\\r\\n\\r\\n_See_ page 48.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nArtichoke Chips\\r\\n\\r\\nCook as before; slice, fry in boiling fat. Drain and leave till cold.\\r\\nFry, drain, and serve very hot.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCream of Artichokes (Hot or Cold)\\r\\n\\r\\nBoil 1 lb. of artichokes until quite tender, then pass them through a\\r\\nsieve. Make a custard with ½ pint of milk and the yolks of four eggs,\\r\\npepper and salt. Whisk up the white of 1 egg, and whisk this into the\\r\\ncustard, mix it with the artichoke and place all in a well-buttered\\r\\nmould and steam for an hour. Serve hot with anchovy sauce, or set the\\r\\nmould on ice, and when quite cold turn it out on to a dish and serve\\r\\nwith iced mayonnaise of hollandaise sauce.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nEggs and Artichokes (Hot)\\r\\n\\r\\nBoil 8 artichokes and cut them into slices, place them in a fireproof\\r\\ndish. Hard boil 4 eggs. When cold shell them and chop them up, place\\r\\nthe eggs on the top of the sliced artichokes, and pour over the whole\\r\\na good white sauce flavoured with Parmesan cheese. Dust over with\\r\\nbreadcrumbs and make thoroughly hot in the oven.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBouchées d’Artichauts (Hot)\\r\\n\\r\\nPrepare the green artichokes by cutting off the leaves close down to\\r\\nthe fond and trim off any that may adhere, cut off the stalk as closely\\r\\nas possible. Plunge the artichoke bottoms into boiling salted water,\\r\\nand leave them for five minutes, then take them out and remove the\\r\\nchoke. Place in boiling water and boil them until tender. When cooked\\r\\ntake them out, drain them, and put them through a sieve, season with\\r\\npepper and salt, moistening the whole with enough white sauce to make a\\r\\npurée. Have ready some pastry patty cases, ready cooked, fill each with\\r\\nthe mixture, and serve very hot.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFonds Artichauts au Gratin (Hot)\\r\\n\\r\\nBoil the artichoke bottoms in the manner described above, mash them and\\r\\nseason with pepper and salt, adding a little cream and butter, place\\r\\nsome of the mixture in china shells or small fireproof dishes, grate\\r\\nsome cheese over each, and bake in the oven until a golden brown.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nStuffed Artichokes.\\r\\n\\r\\nTake the cooked artichoke bottoms and fill with mashed potato flavoured\\r\\nwith cheese. Brown in the oven and serve with cheese sauce.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nArtichokes with Cream Cheese\\r\\n\\r\\nFill the artichoke bottoms with cream of cheese (_see_ page 71), and\\r\\nserve on buttered toast very hot.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMushrooms au Gratin (Hot)\\r\\n\\r\\nPeel the mushrooms and cut off their stalks, and place them in a\\r\\nbuttered fireproof dish. Peel the stalks and wash them, add the\\r\\npeelings, dry them and cut them up. Make a sauce with 1 oz. of\\r\\nbutter, and when melted add ½ oz. of flour, stirring into it ½ pint\\r\\nof milk. Stir well, bring to the boil, and then throw in the chopped\\r\\nstalks, a dessertspoonful of finely-chopped parsley, a teaspoonful of\\r\\nfinely-chopped onion, a dusting of pepper, and ½ a teaspoonful of salt.\\r\\nSimmer the sauce until it thickens, strain and add some browning. Pour\\r\\nthe sauce over the mushrooms, sprinkle some browned breadcrumbs over\\r\\nthe whole, and bake in a quick oven for 10 minutes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMushroom Croûtes (Hot)\\r\\n\\r\\nCut some rounds of bread about ¾ of an inch thick and scoop them out\\r\\nrather thinner in the centre, fry until a golden brown, drain, and keep\\r\\nhot. Place the required number of mushrooms on a greased baking-tin\\r\\nwith a piece of butter in each, and place in the oven to cook. In the\\r\\nmeantime mince one or two mushrooms and place them in a pan with a\\r\\nsmall quantity of good brown sauce. When cooked place a spoonful on\\r\\neach croûte, and a whole mushroom on the top of each. Serve very hot.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nRoes and Mushrooms on Toast (Hot)\\r\\n\\r\\nMake the necessary number of round croûtons of lightly-fried bread, and\\r\\nchoose a like number of mushrooms the same size as the croûtons. Peel\\r\\nthe mushrooms, rinse them in warm water, to remove any grit, and remove\\r\\nthe stalks. Place them on a greased baking sheet, stalk side uppermost.\\r\\nPut some small pieces of butter on each mushroom and a little pepper\\r\\nand salt. Cover with buttered paper and cook in a moderate oven for 10\\r\\nto 20 minutes. Serve a mushroom on each croûton, and on each mushroom\\r\\nplace a cooked bloater roe curled round.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nStuffed Aubergines (Egg Fruit)\\r\\n\\r\\nBoil the aubergines until tender (25 to 30 minutes), and then half them\\r\\nlengthwise. Scoop out the pulp carefully, sieve it, and mix it with\\r\\nsome fine brown crumbs (about a dessertspoonful to each half-pint),\\r\\npepper, salt, and some oiled butter. Fill the skins with this mixture,\\r\\nsprinkle with crumbs and oiled butter, and bake in a moderate oven\\r\\nuntil browned.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTomatoes au Gratin (Hot)\\r\\n\\r\\nTake four tomatoes as nearly the same size as possible, and a slice\\r\\noff the top of each. Scoop out the middle of the tomato as much as\\r\\npossible, leaving the frames for cases. These set on one side. Work\\r\\nthe pulp through a sieve, and mix into it a heaped-up tablespoonful of\\r\\nfinely-grated breadcrumbs, add the yolks of 2 eggs, and mix well. Fill\\r\\nthe tomato cases, heaping the mixture up, grate a layer of cheese over\\r\\nthem, place on a buttered baking dish and bake for 10 minutes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTomato Pie (Hot)\\r\\n\\r\\nSlice a good-sized onion thinly, blanch it, and fry in fat till lightly\\r\\nbrowned. Take 1 lb. of ripe tomatoes, skin and cut in slices. Place a\\r\\nlayer of onions in the bottom of the pie dish with a good seasoning\\r\\nof salt and pepper, then a layer of tomatoes, with white breadcrumbs\\r\\nscattered over and a few pieces of butter, and so on until the dish is\\r\\nalmost full. Have ready some well-mashed potatoes, and spread thickly\\r\\nover so as to form a crust, and bake until brown.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTomatoes à la Crême de Fromage (Cold)\\r\\n\\r\\nWhip ½ pint of cream until stiff, season it with celery salt and\\r\\npepper. Add 3 oz. of grated cheese, then whisk in by degrees ¼ pint of\\r\\ncool but liquid aspic jelly, which has been flavoured with tarragon\\r\\nvinegar. Continue to whisk until the mixture begins to stiffen.\\r\\nPreviously peel and halve some small round tomatoes, and remove the\\r\\nseeds from the halves when cut open, and drain for a little. Place\\r\\neach piece of tomato, when filled, on a cheese biscuit, and ornament\\r\\nit round the edge with a piping of cheese cream. Garnish the dish with\\r\\ncress, and put a tiny bunch into the middle of the cream with which the\\r\\ntomatoes are filled.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTomato Canapés (Cold)\\r\\n\\r\\nCut some slices of bread 2½ in. in diameter, and ⅛ in. thick. Soak\\r\\nin milk and then fry a pale colour. Spread when cold with grated\\r\\ncheese and butter made into a paste. Dip some small tomatoes into hot\\r\\nwater, skin them and put one on each piece of bread, placing some\\r\\nfinely-minced parsley and grated Parmesan on each.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBeignets of Vegetable Marrow (Hot)\\r\\n\\r\\nPeel the vegetable marrow and strain it without removing the seeds.\\r\\nWhen three-parts cooked, take it out of the pan and cut it into neat\\r\\npieces, as much one size as possible, remove the seeds, dip each piece\\r\\nof marrow into batter and fry until a golden brown in boiling fat.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTo Make the Batter\\r\\n\\r\\nWhip two eggs and mix them with about two tablespoonsful of flour. This\\r\\nis generally sufficient to make a stiff batter. Then add by degrees ⅓\\r\\nof a pint of milk, salt and pepper, cover and put by for an hour or\\r\\ntwo. Be sure that the article to be fried is quite dry before being\\r\\ndipped in the batter.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSalsify Scallops (Hot)\\r\\n\\r\\nBoil the salsify for 50 minutes, then place in a mortar and mash to\\r\\na pulp, add a few drops of anchovy essence and some milk or cream,\\r\\nto make it the consistency of a thick custard. Place the mixture in\\r\\nbuttered shells, sprinkle some finely-grated breadcrumbs over it, place\\r\\na piece of butter on each and brown in the oven.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSalsify Fritters (Hot)\\r\\n\\r\\n1½ lb. salsify, 2 oz. beef dripping, lemon juice. Wash and lightly\\r\\nscrape the salsify roots and put them in cold water. Put the dripping,\\r\\na little salt, and the lemon juice in a saucepan with enough water to\\r\\ncover the salsify. When it boils put in the roots and let them simmer\\r\\ngently until they are tender. This will take 30 to 40 minutes. Do not\\r\\ncover the pan. When tender drain off the water and cut the roots into\\r\\npieces about 2½ in. long. Sprinkle the salsify with a little pepper,\\r\\noil, and vinegar, and then dip the pieces into batter. Fry in boiling\\r\\nfat until a golden brown, then take out, drain and serve.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nGlazed Carrots (Hot)\\r\\n\\r\\nBlanch some small, young carrots, as much of a size as possible, dry\\r\\nthem well, and if necessary, trim them evenly; put them into a pan,\\r\\nwith just enough stock to cover, and a lump of loaf sugar; boil them\\r\\nup sharply till the stock is reduced to a glaze, then add to this 1½\\r\\noz. of butter and a seasoning of salt, and stir them in this till the\\r\\nliquid is all absorbed, and the carrots are quite glazed with the\\r\\nbutter.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCarrots à la Flamande (Hot)\\r\\n\\r\\nTake about 12 young carrots, blanch them in scalding water, and rub\\r\\nthem well. Then put them into a stewpan with about 1 oz. of butter, a\\r\\nsaltspoonful of castor sugar, some finely-minced parsley, a seasoning\\r\\nof pepper and salt, and sufficient water to cover them liberally;\\r\\nsimmer the carrots in this for about 15 to 20 minutes, when they should\\r\\nbe quite tender, shaking them once or twice in the process. Remove\\r\\nthe pan from the fire, and stir in the yolk of 1 egg beaten up with 2\\r\\nspoonsful of cream or new milk, and serve very hot.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nGlazed Turnips (Hot)\\r\\n\\r\\nPeel about 1 lb. of young turnips, wash them well, cut into quarters,\\r\\nand put them on in salted water; bring this sharply to the boil, then\\r\\nplace them in a well-buttered small frying or sauté pan, sprinkle them\\r\\nliberally with castor sugar, and directly the turnips begin to colour\\r\\npour a little stock in, and season with pepper and salt, and a little\\r\\nmore sugar if liked; let them stew slowly till quite tender, and serve\\r\\nthem with the sauce poured over them.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTurnips à la Poulette (Hot)\\r\\n\\r\\nPeel about 1 lb. of young, fresh turnips, wash them well, trim into\\r\\nolive or pear shapes; put them on in cold, salted water, and bring them\\r\\nsharply to the boil; then drain them, rinse in cold water, and dry them\\r\\nin a clean napkin. Have ready some velouté (i.e. melted butter made\\r\\nwith 1 oz. of butter, 1½ oz. of flour, and about ¾ pint of vegetable\\r\\nstock instead of water), drop the turnips into this, and cook them till\\r\\nready, very gently, for about 20 to 25 minutes according to size. When\\r\\nready lift them out, and keep hot. Add a spoonful of castor sugar to\\r\\nthe liquor, boil it up sharply, and just before serving stir in the\\r\\nyolk of an egg and a little piece of butter cut up small; do not let\\r\\nthe sauce reboil after adding these; season to taste with pepper and\\r\\nsalt, pour the sauce on to the turnips, and serve very hot.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOnions au Gratin\\r\\n\\r\\nBlanch (by placing in boiling water) 1 lb. of onions, then divide them\\r\\ninto quarters and boil in milk and water until tender. Cut them up,\\r\\nmoisten them with some of the liquid in which they were boiled, mash\\r\\nthem smoothly, add a cupful of cream, or one of milk enriched with the\\r\\nyolk of an egg, pepper and salt. Place the purée in a fireproof dish,\\r\\nwhich has been buttered, strew some grated cheese over, and sprinkle a\\r\\nlittle melted butter over all. Bake until hot throughout, and until the\\r\\ntop is coloured.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is worthy of note that where grated cheese is mentioned, it is quite\\r\\nunnecessary to buy Parmesan for the purpose. Any dry ends of cheese,\\r\\ngrated, will serve.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCeleri à la Duchesse (Hot)\\r\\n\\r\\nCook some celery slowly in equal parts of milk and water, seasoned\\r\\nwith salt and pepper; when cooked, lift out, cut it up, and place a\\r\\nlayer of it in a fireproof dish, seasoning with salt and pepper, and\\r\\nmoistening with some béchamel or any good white sauce, and continue\\r\\nthese layers until the dish is full, taking care to raise it up in the\\r\\ncentre; strew it rather thickly with grated Parmesan cheese; moisten\\r\\nit with some oiled butter, and put it into the oven for 10 minutes, to\\r\\ncolour nicely.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFried Celery (Hot)\\r\\n\\r\\nThoroughly wash three heads of celery, remove the leaves, and cut into\\r\\n4 inch lengths, then put in a stewpan with ½ a pint of stock and a\\r\\nseasoning of pepper and salt. Simmer gently for a quarter of an hour.\\r\\nLet the celery cool, then take it out, dip it in egg and breadcrumb,\\r\\nand fry in butter. Serve very hot, and hand tomato sauce with it.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the following vegetable dishes, _see 10s. a Head for Housebooks_:--\\r\\n\\r\\n  Potato Cakes, Ribbons, à la Maître d’Hôtel, Balls, Cones, Eggs au\\r\\n  Gratin, Tomato Savoury, and Cabbage Cakes.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Cauliflower au Gratin, and Curried.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Artichoke Chips.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Tomato Rice.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Vegetable Marrow au Gratin.

Freshly cut, boiled, and eaten with salt, pepper, and oiled\\r\\nbutter, it is delicious; but every one, alas, does not grow it, and\\r\\nmany folk have to be content with the tinned corn, which, nevertheless,\\r\\nis excellent. It may be bought in tins of two sizes, and is quite\\r\\ninexpensive.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTo Cook Corn\\r\\n\\r\\nOpen a small tin of corn and strain off the liquid, and then simmer\\r\\nthe corn until tender, but not “mashy,” in 3 tablespoonsful of milk, ½\\r\\noz. of butter, pepper and salt. About 10 minutes will suffice for the\\r\\ncooking.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCorn with Buttered Egg\\r\\n\\r\\nHave ready the buttered egg, and pile it in the centre of a hot\\r\\nfireproof dish, surround with the cooked corn and garnish with small\\r\\ncircles of fried bread.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nEgg and Corn Toast\\r\\n\\r\\nPrepare the egg and corn as before, stir them together and serve very\\r\\nhot on buttered toast.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCorn with Poached Eggs\\r\\n\\r\\nSpread the cooked corn flat on a hot fireproof dish, and arrange the\\r\\npoached eggs neatly on it, and serve very hot.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCorn au Gratin\\r\\n\\r\\nCook the corn as before, and have ready a delicate white sauce as\\r\\nbelow. Heat a fireproof dish, butter it, and sprinkle with fine brown\\r\\ncrumbs. Heat the corn in the sauce, and place it in the dish, cover\\r\\nwith grated cheese and crumbs, and bake for 20 minutes in a hot oven.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhite Sauce\\r\\n\\r\\nMelt 2 oz. of fresh butter, and sprinkle into it 1½ oz. of dry sifted\\r\\nflour. Stir until the sauce will leave a clean place in the pan when\\r\\nlifted in the spoon. Add quite gradually ½ pint of milk, stirring all\\r\\nthe time. Bring to the boil, and cook for 10 minutes. Season with salt\\r\\nand white pepper and a squeeze of lemon juice. Half water and half milk\\r\\nor stock may be used instead of all milk, and a spoonful or two of\\r\\ncream added just at the last is an improvement. If a\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCheese Sauce\\r\\n\\r\\nis required add a piled-up tablespoonful of finely-grated cheese,\\r\\nstirring it in well so that it shall be smooth.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCorn au Gratin with Tomato Sauce\\r\\n\\r\\nPrepare as before, using tomato sauce instead of white sauce.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTomato Sauce\\r\\n\\r\\nTake 6 small tomatoes, slice them and place in a pan with 1 oz. of\\r\\nbutter, salt and pepper, and 1 pint of stock and water, or milk and\\r\\nwater. Boil until soft, sieve, and thicken with 1 oz. of white roux\\r\\n(flour and butter cooked until smooth, as described in “White Sauce”).\\r\\nStir until smooth and very hot.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCorn Fritters\\r\\n\\r\\n½ tin of corn, 2 eggs, 2 tablespoonsful of flour, 1 tablespoonful\\r\\nfinely-chopped parsley, seasoning to taste. Drain the corn into a\\r\\nbowl; stir in the flour carefully, add the parsley, season, and\\r\\nlastly, well beat the eggs, and stir those in. Have ready some boiling\\r\\nfat in a frying-pan, into which the batter should be dropped in\\r\\ndessertspoonsful. Drain on kitchen paper, and serve at once on a hot\\r\\ndish.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCorn Rissoles.\\r\\n\\r\\nTake the cooked corn and beat it in white, cheese, or tomato sauce, and\\r\\nthen leave until cold. Form into rissoles, egg and crumb and fry. Serve\\r\\nvery hot, garnished with fried parsley.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOmelette with Corn\\r\\n\\r\\nPrepare the omelette as usual, and have ready some corn heated in white\\r\\nsauce. Just before serving the omelette spread the inner portion with\\r\\nthe hot corn.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCurried Corn.\\r\\n\\r\\nPrepare the corn as before, and heat in a good curry sauce. Pile in\\r\\nthe centre of a hot dish and surround with boiled rice garnished with\\r\\nsieved yolk of egg.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCurry Sauce\\r\\n\\r\\nSlice an onion and ½ a small apple finely, and fry them in 2 oz. of\\r\\nclarified dripping or butter. Stir in ½ a dessertspoonful of curry\\r\\npowder and the same of flour. Salt to taste. Add ¼ pint of stock or\\r\\nmilk, cook gently for 30 minutes, then put all through a sieve, add a\\r\\nfew drops of lemon juice, and reheat.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“Humitas”\\r\\n\\r\\n(_A Chili dish_)\\r\\n\\r\\nGrate some fresh green corn, add a little sugar and red pepper.\\r\\n\\r\\nFry this slightly in clarified dripping. Arrange two leaves from the\\r\\nsugar-corn, the broad part lapping over the other. Fill this with about\\r\\na tablespoonful of the mixture, then fold it up neatly in the leaves,\\r\\ntying it with a thin strip from another, and bake.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the fresh corn is not in season, the corn in tins will answer the\\r\\nsame purpose if cooked and passed through a wire sieve and wrapped in\\r\\nvine leaves.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCorn and Cheese Cream\\r\\n\\r\\nCook the corn, mix it into the cheese cream, and serve very hot on\\r\\nbuttered toast. For the Cheese Cream _see_ page 71.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe serving of these recipes may be varied: for instance, instead of\\r\\nsending corn au gratin to table in one large dish, bake and serve it\\r\\nin small brown or green earthen pipkins, one to each person, or in the\\r\\ncentre of a croûton of fried bread.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is worth noting, too, that haricot beans may be substituted for corn\\r\\nin any of these recipes. They should be soaked for 2 to 4 hours, and\\r\\nthen boiled in stock or water for 3 hours.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHaricot Beans\\r\\n\\r\\nHaricot beans must be soaked for quite 12 hours in cold water, then put\\r\\ninto a pan with cold water slightly salted, (½ oz. of salt to 1 gallon\\r\\nof water,) brought slowly to the boil, then drawn aside and simmered\\r\\nfor about 2 hours.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHaricot Beans à la Milanaise (Hot)\\r\\n\\r\\nBoil the beans as directed and serve with a covering of sauce à la\\r\\nMilanaise, which should be made in the following manner: Scald 4\\r\\nonions for 5 minutes in boiling water, then dry them and cut them up,\\r\\nplace them in a saucepan with a pinch of sugar, 1 oz. of butter, and\\r\\na saltspoonful of salt. Boil a tablespoonful of rice, and when cooked\\r\\nadd it to the onion; moisten with ½ pint of milk or water, cook slowly,\\r\\nstirring occasionally; when the onions are soft add 1 tablespoonful of\\r\\nfinely-grated cheese. Mix well and pass through a sieve, add to this ½\\r\\npint of white sauce, mix thoroughly, repeat and pour over the beans.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHaricot Beans with Tomato Purée\\r\\n\\r\\nCook the beans as before and serve covered with tomato purée (_see_\\r\\npage 18.)\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHaricot Beans with Soubise (Onion) Sauce\\r\\n\\r\\nCook the haricots as before and serve with onion sauce poured over and\\r\\ncroûtons of fried bread arranged round.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSoubise Sauce\\r\\n\\r\\nTake 2 large onions, peel them and put them in boiling water for 5\\r\\nminutes. Strain, slice, and place in a pan with 1 oz. of clarified\\r\\ndripping and stew until tender. Lift the pan from the fire and stir\\r\\nin ½ pint of melted butter sauce. Let it boil, stir for about 7 to 10\\r\\nminutes, and then rub through a hair sieve.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLentils\\r\\n\\r\\nSoak the lentils for at least 12 hours in cold water. Then drain and\\r\\nplace them in a pan with cold salted water (1 gallon of water to ½\\r\\noz. of salt), bring them to the boil, then draw aside the pan and\\r\\nsimmer, until the lentils are quite soft, about 1 hour. After having\\r\\nbeen cooked like this they can be served in any of the methods advised,\\r\\nfor haricot beans or plain, save for the addition of a pat of butter\\r\\nmelting among them, a sprinkling of chopped parsley, and a shake of\\r\\npepper and salt.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLentils with Curry Sauce\\r\\n\\r\\nCook the lentils as before and serve with plenty of curried sauce\\r\\npoured over. For the curry sauce _see_ page 45.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMaigre Soufflés\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is no nicer way of serving such vegetables as cabbage, spinach,\\r\\nartichokes, or celery, than in the form of a soufflé, which may appear\\r\\nas an entrée or second course dish, or as a vegetable to accompany meat\\r\\nor poultry.\\r\\n\\r\\nSavoury soufflés of rice and of macaroni are also delicious, and\\r\\nalthough all soufflés require care in the cooking, a cook of moderate\\r\\nabilities will soon master the art of making these delicious dishes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nVegetable Soufflé\\r\\n\\r\\nHave ready about ½ lb. of any carefully made and well-flavoured\\r\\nvegetable purée--spinach, cabbage, turnip tops, Brussels-sprouts,\\r\\ncarrot, turnip (or both mixed) artichoke, tomato, or celery. Then put\\r\\n1 gill of water and 1 oz. of butter into a pan with a pinch of salt.\\r\\nDirectly this comes to the boil, stir in 1 oz. of flour, stirring it\\r\\nwell with a wooden spoon for 2 or 3 minutes, put in the purée, and just\\r\\nremove the pan for a little, add the yolks of 2 eggs, 1 at a time,\\r\\nand 1 whole egg, and finally the whites of 2 eggs beaten to a stiff\\r\\nfroth. Have ready a papered soufflé dish, fill it three-quarters of the\\r\\nway up, bake in a hot oven for 10 minutes, and serve at once, first\\r\\nremoving the paper and wiping the dish.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe purée may be prepared at any time, but the eggs should only be\\r\\nadded just before the soufflé is to be baked. The dish (china or tin)\\r\\nin which the soufflé is baked must be well greased and a greased paper\\r\\ntied round. The mixture rises so strenuously that if the dish is 3\\r\\nparts full (and it should be to look well when served), the paper is\\r\\nrequired to prevent the mixture from falling over, as it rises just\\r\\nabove the edges of the dish. When baking the soufflé do not bang the\\r\\noven door, and open it very gently, and, by degrees when taking the\\r\\nsoufflé out. If kept waiting the soufflé will fall and become tough. So\\r\\nwith these dishes the diners must wait for the soufflé rather than the\\r\\nsoufflé for the diners.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nVegetable Purée\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is merely the vegetable boiled in water or stock, and then put\\r\\nthrough a sieve so that it forms a preparation resembling a very thick\\r\\ncustard. Spinach à la crême (page 20) and purée of watercress, lettuce,\\r\\nand turnip tops (pages 16 and 17) are excellent foundations for\\r\\nsoufflés. Such vegetables as artichokes and celery should be treated as\\r\\nfollows:--\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCelery Soufflé (Hot)\\r\\n\\r\\nWash some celery well, and remove all the outside parts, cut up ½ lb.,\\r\\nput it on in cold, salted water, bring this to the boil, take out the\\r\\ncelery and drain. Put the celery into a pan with 1½ gills of milk, half\\r\\na bayleaf, a blade of mace, a slice of onion, and boil it all till\\r\\ntender, then sieve the celery, and it is ready for the soufflé.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSavoury Rice Soufflé\\r\\n\\r\\nWash 2 oz. of rice and then place it in ¾ of a pint of boiling stock\\r\\n(fish or vegetable stock), and cook until the rice swells and is soft\\r\\nwithout being pulpy. Drain it and let it cool, and then stir into it\\r\\n1 oz. of fresh butter, 2 or 3 tablespoonsful of tomato purée, salt and\\r\\npepper the beaten yolks of 2 eggs and then the frothed whites. Bake in\\r\\na soufflé dish prepared as already described.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMushroom and Rice Soufflé\\r\\n\\r\\nProceed as before, but use stewed mushrooms instead of the tomato purée.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nRice and Cheese Soufflé\\r\\n\\r\\nProceed exactly as for Savoury Rice Soufflé but add 2 oz. of grated\\r\\ncheese.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMacaroni Soufflé\\r\\n\\r\\nProceed as for Rice Soufflé, using about the same bulk of cooked\\r\\nmacaroni (cut into half inch lengths) as of cooked rice.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER IV\\r\\n\\r\\nDISHES MADE WITH MACARONI AND SPAGHETTI\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMacaroni and Spaghetti\\r\\n\\r\\n_To Boil._--Macaroni or spaghetti should be boiled in the same way as\\r\\nrice, namely, thrown into boiling salted water, and should never under\\r\\nany circumstances be soaked or placed in cold water previously. They\\r\\nshould be tested occasionally with a fork, and when tender a teacupful\\r\\nof cold water should be thrown into the pan to stop the boiling, the\\r\\npan should then be lifted from the fire, the macaroni or spaghetti\\r\\ndrained of all liquid and returned to the hot dry pan and kept hot\\r\\nuntil wanted. The time for boiling is from 20 to 30 minutes. The\\r\\nfollowing dishes can be made of either preparation:--\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMacaroni à la Napolitaine (Hot)\\r\\n\\r\\nBoil 3 oz. of macaroni in the manner described above, and after it has\\r\\nbeen returned to the pan in which it was boiled, stir into it 2 oz. of\\r\\nParmesan cheese finely grated and 1 oz. of butter. The cheese should be\\r\\nstirred in half at a time and well shaken amongst the macaroni. Season\\r\\nwith black pepper and salt and serve at once very hot.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMacaroni à la Italienne (Hot)\\r\\n\\r\\nFollow the preceding recipe for boiling the macaroni, and having\\r\\nreturned it to the pan, stir into it 1 oz. of cheese finely grated, 1\\r\\noz. of butter, and then ½ pint of tomato purée (_see_ page 18). Mix\\r\\nwell and serve very hot piled on a dish.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMacaroni au Gratin (Hot)\\r\\n\\r\\nBoil the macaroni by the directions given above, then mix into it 1 oz.\\r\\nof grated cheese and 1 oz. of butter, stir well and place the mixture\\r\\nneatly in a fireproof dish, sprinkle over it ½ oz. of grated cheese and\\r\\nthe same amount of dried breadcrumbs. Melt ½ oz. of butter and pour it\\r\\nover the whole. Place in the oven (until a light brown colour) for 10\\r\\nminutes, then serve.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMacaroni Cheese (Hot)\\r\\n\\r\\nButter a fireproof dish and in it place 3 oz. of macaroni previously\\r\\nboiled, dust it with pepper and salt. Make a good white sauce and add\\r\\nto it 2 oz. of grated cheese. Pour this all over the macaroni and\\r\\nsprinkle the top with grated cheese and a few dried breadcrumbs. Place\\r\\nin the oven and cook until a golden brown and serve in the dish in\\r\\nwhich it is cooked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMacaroni au Jus (made with Meat Stock) (Hot)\\r\\n\\r\\nBoil 3 oz. of macaroni for 10 minutes, drain off the water and pour\\r\\ninto the pan ½ to ¾ pint of brown stock, simmer the macaroni until\\r\\ntender, pour off the stock; but should the macaroni have absorbed it\\r\\nall, take enough to moisten the whole, thicken it in the usual way, and\\r\\nadd browning to colour it. Place the macaroni on a hot dish--it should\\r\\nbe kept hot in the pan while the sauce is making; pour the gravy over\\r\\nit and serve.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nButtered Macaroni (Hot)\\r\\n\\r\\nBoil 2 oz. of macaroni and drain it well. Put 2 oz. of butter into a\\r\\nthoroughly warmed pie dish, put the macaroni on top of this, and mix\\r\\nit all well together with two forks, sprinkling in at the same time\\r\\nfreshly-grated cheese and coralline pepper. When thoroughly mixed and\\r\\nthe butter all absorbed, sprinkle it with more pepper and cheese, and\\r\\nserve at once.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPoached Eggs and Macaroni (Hot)\\r\\n\\r\\nBreak some macaroni up into inch pieces, rinse it well; put 2 oz. of\\r\\nbutter into a fireproof dish, put the macaroni in, and pour enough\\r\\nmilk over it to thoroughly cover it, stirring it now and again. When\\r\\nthree-quarters cooked, lift it out, and put it into another dish,\\r\\nseasoning it well with pepper and salt, and pour over it ½ pint of\\r\\ngood brown gravy, then put it back in the oven again and leave it till\\r\\ncooked. When ready lay some poached eggs on it, sprinkle liberally with\\r\\nParmesan cheese, coralline pepper, and serve.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMacaroni Cutlets (Hot)\\r\\n\\r\\n4 oz. macaroni, 4 oz. grated cheese, 1 oz. flour, ½ oz. flour, ½ pint\\r\\nof milk, 1 teaspoonful French mustard, breadcrumbs, 1 egg, cayenne and\\r\\nsalt. Boil the macaroni in water until it is quite tender, then cut it\\r\\ninto pieces of half an inch in length. Melt the butter in a stewpan,\\r\\nadd the flour gradually, stirring until there are no lumps, add the\\r\\nmilk and stir over the fire until the sauce thickens. Mix the macaroni,\\r\\ncheese, mustard, pinch of cayenne and salt to taste, with the sauce,\\r\\nthen turn out on to a plate and leave until cold. Form into cutlets or\\r\\nsmall rolls, roll in breadcrumbs, then dip in beaten egg, and again\\r\\nroll in crumbs. Fry the cutlets in boiling fat until they are a golden\\r\\nbrown colour, then serve with a garnish of fried parsley. If the\\r\\nmixture is formed into cutlet shape place a small piece of raw macaroni\\r\\nat the thin end to represent the bone.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFish and Macaroni (Hot)\\r\\n\\r\\nCook the macaroni until quite tender, then cut it into small pieces;\\r\\nmeanwhile flake ½ lb. of cooked fish, free from shin and bones, and\\r\\nmake a good stock from the bones and trimmings of the fish. Melt 1 oz.\\r\\nof butter, stir into this ½ oz. of flour, strain in ½ pint of the fish\\r\\nstock, and bring it all to the boil; then put in the fish and macaroni,\\r\\nseason to taste with salt and pepper, turn into a buttered fireproof\\r\\ndish, and bake in the oven for 10 minutes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMacaroni with Tomatoes\\r\\n\\r\\nRemove the stalks of the tomatoes, cut each one into four pieces, then\\r\\nput them into a saucepan with a little water, a bayleaf, and a sprig\\r\\nof basil, and season with pepper and salt to taste; now boil till\\r\\nthoroughly done, when you turn them out on to a hair sieve, allowing\\r\\nthem to stand for a minute or so, in order that all the water may\\r\\ndrain off and be thrown away; then pass the tomatoes through a sieve\\r\\nwith a wooden spoon, heat up the pulp well with a good lump of butter,\\r\\nand then dress the previously-boiled macaroni with this, and plenty\\r\\nof grated Parmesan, or any good, strongly flavoured cheese which will\\r\\ngrate well.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nItalian Cake (Hot) (made with Suet)\\r\\n\\r\\nBoil 2 oz. of macaroni till tender, drain well and cut into small\\r\\npieces, then pound it with 2 eggs, 8 oz. of grated Parmesan cheese, 4\\r\\noz. mutton suet, and season to taste with pepper and salt; steam in a\\r\\nbasin or mould for 70 minutes. Turn out and serve with tomato or any\\r\\nother savoury sauce to taste. 2 beaten yolks of egg may be substituted\\r\\nfor the suet.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSpaghetti Pudding (Hot)\\r\\n\\r\\nCook 4 oz. of spaghetti as previously directed, drain it and place half\\r\\nof it in a pie dish, grate 2 oz. of cheese (a good cooking one should\\r\\nbe chosen), and sprinkle some of it over the spaghetti, slice 4 or 5\\r\\nsmall tomatoes and place them on the bed of macaroni, sprinkling them\\r\\nwith cheese, pepper and salt, and finish with the remainder of the\\r\\nmacaroni, placing the rest of the cheese on the top. Pour carefully\\r\\nover this ½ pint of milk and cover the dish with a plate or small dish,\\r\\ncook in a moderate oven. A fireproof dish with a fitting cover would be\\r\\nuseful for this dish, but if not procurable a pie dish can quite well\\r\\nbe used.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBaked Tomatoes and Macaroni (Hot)\\r\\n\\r\\nCut 4 or 5 tomatoes of the same size into halves and place them in a\\r\\nbaking-tin with a small piece of butter on each and dust them with\\r\\nblack pepper and nutmeg. Bake from 15 to 20 minutes. Have ready 6 oz.\\r\\nof macaroni boiled and hot, place this in a circle on a hot dish,\\r\\narrange the tomatoes inside this and pour over the spaghetti a rich\\r\\ncheese sauce. Serve very hot.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSpaghetti à l’Indienne (Hot)\\r\\n\\r\\nMake a curry sauce by slicing 2 small onions and frying them in butter\\r\\nuntil a light brown, add to them 2 teaspoonsful of curry powder and a\\r\\ntablespoonful of lemon juice or rather less of vinegar, a tablespoonful\\r\\nof sugar, a pinch of salt and two raw apples chopped very finely, stir\\r\\nin 1½ pints of water and simmer until the ingredients have become a\\r\\npulp. Place ½ lb. of spaghetti in boiling water, and when partly cooked\\r\\nremove it, drain, and finish cooking it in the sauce. Serve very hot.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER V\\r\\n\\r\\nDISHES MADE WITH RICE\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nRice\\r\\n\\r\\n_To Boil._--Place the rice in a pan of fast boiling water and be\\r\\ncareful to choose one large enough for it. 1 to 1½ oz. of rice should\\r\\nbe cooked in a quart pan, which should be three-parts full of water,\\r\\nand have ½ a teaspoonful of salt and a few drops of lemon juice in it,\\r\\nthe latter to preserve the whiteness of the rice. Stir occasionally.\\r\\nBoil the rice for 10 to 15 minutes, but test it at the former time by\\r\\npressing it between the finger and thumb. When the grains feel soft\\r\\nremove the saucepan from the fire at once and drain off the water;\\r\\nreturn the rice to the pan and set it on the corner of the stove to\\r\\ndry, shaking it occasionally. Some grains of rice will always stick\\r\\nto the pan, and to remove these put a small pat of butter in the pan,\\r\\nand as this melts the grains will fall away. The rice will take quite\\r\\n10 minutes to dry and should never be served until the moisture has\\r\\nbeen got rid of and the grains separated. Remember always that rice\\r\\nswells very much in the cooking process, hence the necessity of the\\r\\nlarge pan and amount of water required. Carolina rice swells more than\\r\\nPatna and so requires rather more water than the latter. If the rice is\\r\\nboiled too slowly or for too long a time the result will be a sticky\\r\\nmass. A good plan is to pour in a pint of cold water when the rice\\r\\nis sufficiently cooked. This stops the boiling at once and helps to\\r\\nseparate the grains; if put close to the stove when the rice is first\\r\\nput into the pan, the cook will be able to throw it into the pan the\\r\\nmoment the rice is tender. If the rice is to be served with meat in\\r\\nplace of a vegetable, the rice should only be partly cooked and the\\r\\nwater all drained off, and then ½ pint to 1 pint of stock put in the\\r\\npan. This should be simmered until quite cooked, drained and served.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother method of boiling rice, though totally different to the\\r\\nforegoing, is equally successful. Place the rice in cold water and\\r\\nallow it to come to the boil. After boiling for a few minutes and when\\r\\nthe grains are tender when pressed between the finger and thumb, throw\\r\\nin a jugful of cold water, remove the pan from the fire, and pour both\\r\\nrice and water on to a wire sieve, shake well, and when the water has\\r\\nrun away sufficiently, place the sieve with the rice upon it in the\\r\\noven to thoroughly dry it. The grains will fall away from each other\\r\\nand the rice is ready for use.\\r\\n\\r\\nRice is even better as a vegetable if it is cooked some time before\\r\\nbeing wanted, covered over, and reheated in the oven before use; the\\r\\ngrains are drier than when only cooked and served at once.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFried Rice\\r\\n\\r\\n_Served as a vegetable_\\r\\n\\r\\nBoil ½ lb. of rice as directed, and when it is thoroughly dried fry it\\r\\nin 1 oz. of butter until slightly browned. Dust with pepper and salt\\r\\nand serve piled in a dish.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDevilled Rice\\r\\n\\r\\nProceed as for Fried Rice, but mix in a pinch of curry powder with the\\r\\nhot liquid butter.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nRice à l’Italienne (Hot)\\r\\n\\r\\nBoil the rice in the manner described on page 60, and to 4 oz. when\\r\\ncooked and drained, stir in 1 oz. of butter, dust with salt and pepper\\r\\nand stir well, mixing thoroughly; add sufficient tomato sauce to\\r\\nmoisten the whole, and add 2 oz. of finely-grated cheese. Mix well and\\r\\nserve very hot.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nRisotto à la Milanaise (Hot)\\r\\n\\r\\nFry 3 oz. of chopped onion in 2 oz. of butter or clarified dripping\\r\\nuntil of a golden brown colour, then add 6 oz. of rice, stir without\\r\\nstopping for 2 or 3 minutes, add by degrees 1 pint of stock, stir\\r\\noccasionally and simmer gently until the rice is just soft, add a very\\r\\nsmall amount of grated nutmeg and 1½ oz. of grated cheese before the\\r\\nrice is cooked; after this stir and cook for 3 or 4 minutes until the\\r\\nrice is quite soft. Take off the pan, add a small pat of butter, stir\\r\\nwell and serve very hot.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nRisotto, No. 1 (Hot)\\r\\n\\r\\nPlace in a saucepan ½ pint of milk, a small teacupful of raw rice, 4\\r\\nsmall Portugal onions, 6 good-sized tomatoes, these latter ingredients\\r\\nchopped finely, pepper and salt to taste. Boil all together until\\r\\nsoft, stirring occasionally, and just before serving stir in 1½ oz. of\\r\\nfinely-grated cheese.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nRisotto, No. 2, made with Stock (Hot)\\r\\n\\r\\nChop half an onion very finely and fry it in ½ oz. of butter. Place 4\\r\\noz. of rice in a saucepan with ½ pint of stock, add the onion and cook\\r\\nuntil the stock is absorbed. Stir in 1 oz. of grated Parmesan cheese,\\r\\npepper and salt to taste. Make very hot and serve.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nStewed Rice and Cabbage, made with Stock (Hot)\\r\\n\\r\\nBoil in the ordinary way separately equal quantities of rice and\\r\\ncabbage. The latter cut into small pieces before they are quite cooked,\\r\\nremove them from their respective pans and place them together in a\\r\\nstewpan with just as much stock as will cover them, simmer until quite\\r\\ncooked (probable time, 5 minutes), and serve with a covering of grated\\r\\ncheese.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nRice Savoury (Hot)\\r\\n\\r\\nBoil 3 oz. of rice in ½ pint of milk, season with pepper and salt;\\r\\nbutter a pie dish, lay in a layer of rice, sprinkle this with 1 oz. of\\r\\ngrated cheese, add the rest of the rice, sprinkle with another ounce\\r\\nof cheese, dot some small pieces of butter all over the top; bake in a\\r\\nquick oven till nicely browned on the top.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nRice Balls (Hot)\\r\\n\\r\\nBoil 4 oz. of rice in cold water, taking care to let it absorb all\\r\\nthe liquid; to this add 1 tablespoonful of finely-grated cheese,\\r\\n1 teaspoonful of chopped parsley, 1 oz. of finely-grated brown\\r\\nbreadcrumbs, 1 tablespoonful of tomato sauce, pepper and salt to taste;\\r\\nbind all the ingredients with the yolks of 2 eggs, mixing thoroughly,\\r\\nform into balls, brush over with white of egg, roll in breadcrumbs and\\r\\nfry a golden brown.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nRice and Fish Toast (Hot)\\r\\n\\r\\nFry an onion, finely-sliced, in butter with a few shrimps or pieces of\\r\\nlobster, stir into it 1 dessertspoonful of mustard.

Stir it all till thoroughly melted, pour it over hot\\r\\nbuttered toast, browning the surface if you like with a hot shovel, and\\r\\nserve at once.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis requires careful watching, because if it be in the least\\r\\nover-cooked it will be leathery.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIrish Rarebit (Hot)\\r\\n\\r\\nAdd a few drops of vinegar and a finely-minced pickled gherkin to\\r\\ncheese treated as above, and serve very hot.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBaked Cheese Sandwiches (Hot)\\r\\n\\r\\nCut some slices of good, rich cheese about a third of an inch thick,\\r\\nseason lightly with freshly-ground black pepper, and a drop or two of\\r\\ntarragon vinegar; then place them between two slices of brown bread\\r\\nand butter; trim these neatly, and set them in the oven, serving them\\r\\ndirectly the bread is toasted.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nParmesan Puffs (Hot)\\r\\n\\r\\nMix 4½ oz. of breadcrumbs, 4 oz. of Parmesan cheese, 2 oz. of butter, ½\\r\\na teaspoonful of cayenne pepper and salt, and 2 eggs; pound these all\\r\\nthoroughly in a mortar, bind them with a well-beaten egg, shape into\\r\\nballs about the size of a walnut, egg and breadcrumb them, and fry a\\r\\ngolden brown in plenty of boiling fat. Drain well, and serve at once\\r\\nvery hot, garnished with parsley.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nParmesan Eggs (Hot)\\r\\n\\r\\nTake a flat fireproof dish and put into it the yolks of 2 eggs, a\\r\\nsmall pat of butter, some spice, and a tablespoonful of finely-grated\\r\\nParmesan cheese. Stir over the stove. Then break into it five or six\\r\\neggs and sprinkle the whole with grated cheese. Brown and serve.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCheese Balls (Hot)\\r\\n\\r\\nPut 1 pint of water into a pan with 1 oz. of butter when quite hot,\\r\\ndredge in 4 oz. of flour, and pepper and salt to taste, draw to one\\r\\nside and when cooled a little add the yolks of 4 eggs and 4 oz. of\\r\\ngrated cheese. Have ready a pan of boiling fat, take the mixture up in\\r\\ntablespoonsful, drop in and fry a golden brown. Serve very hot.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCheese Butterflies (Cold)\\r\\n\\r\\nTake 2 oz. of flour, 1½ oz. of Parmesan cheese, 1 oz. of butter and\\r\\nthe yolk of 1 egg. Make a pastry of the above ingredients and roll out\\r\\nthin. Then with a crinkled round cutter cut out double the number of\\r\\nrounds you require to use and bake a light brown. Allow them to become\\r\\ncold. Mix some grated cheese with a little whipped cream to a nice\\r\\nthick consistency, season with salt and cayenne pepper, pile lightly\\r\\non the rounds of pastry. (Some of the rounds must be cut into halves\\r\\n_before baking_ to provide the wings for the butterflies.) Dip the\\r\\ncrinkled edges of the halves into carmine to colour them, and arrange\\r\\nthem as wings on the rounds of pastry. Put a piece of stalk of parsley\\r\\nto form each antennae; also arrange or ornament the back of each\\r\\nbutterfly with a little of the green leaf of the parsley.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCheese Pudding (Hot)\\r\\n\\r\\nPlace 1 pint of milk in a saucepan and let it become hot, then pour it\\r\\non to 1 tablespoonful of ground rice previously mixed with a little\\r\\ncold milk, return to the pan and stir until the mixture thickens.\\r\\nRemove the pan from the fire and add 4 oz. of finely-grated cheese, a\\r\\npinch of salt and cayenne, the yolks of 2 eggs, and 2 oz. of butter.\\r\\nMix all well together and then add the beaten whites of the eggs.\\r\\nButter a pie dish and pour the mixture into it, and bake in a moderate\\r\\noven for 20 minutes. Sprinkle grated cheese over the top before serving.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCheese Aigrettes (Hot)\\r\\n\\r\\nPlace 1 oz. of butter in a pan with ½ pint of water; when boiling add\\r\\n3 oz. of flour. Stir over the fire until the mixture leaves the sides\\r\\nof the pan quite clean. Remove the pan from the fire and when slightly\\r\\ncool add the yolks of 3 eggs and the whites of 2, cayenne and salt to\\r\\ntaste. Stir in 2 oz. of grated Parmesan cheese, and place the mixture\\r\\non a plate to cool. Take a small piece of the mixture in a spoon and\\r\\ndrop it in hot fat and fry a golden brown; continue this until it is\\r\\nused up. Serve on a dish paper garnished with parsley and sprinkled\\r\\nwith grated cheese.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCheese Patties (Hot)\\r\\n\\r\\nLine some patty pans with puff pastry and fill them three-parts full\\r\\nwith the following mixture. Place 2 oz. of finely-grated breadcrumbs\\r\\nin a basin and mix into them 1 raw egg and a tablespoonful of milk;\\r\\nthen add 2 tablespoonsful of finely-grated cheese and 2 teaspoonsful of\\r\\nbutter, 1 teaspoonful of made mustard, ½ a teaspoonful of salt and the\\r\\nsame of pepper. Mix very well. Place the patties in the oven and bake\\r\\nuntil a pale brown. The mixture will swell slightly in baking. Serve\\r\\nvery hot.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCheese Mushrooms (Hot)\\r\\n\\r\\nTake ½ lb. of rich toasting cheese, slice it, place it on a soup plate.\\r\\nCover it with flap mushrooms--on each mushroom a nut of butter and a\\r\\ndust of pepper and salt. Cover with another soup plate and bake in a\\r\\nmoderate oven for half an hour. Dish up on buttered toast.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCheese Custard Pudding (Hot or Cold)\\r\\n\\r\\nPut 2 oz. of finely-grated cheese into a basin and add to it 2\\r\\nwell-beaten eggs and ¾ pint of milk. Trim the edge of a pie dish with\\r\\ncheese pastry and pour in the mixture. Place 2 or 3 pieces of butter on\\r\\nthe top and bake in a quick oven (400 deg.) for 20 minutes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCheese Croûtons (Hot)\\r\\n\\r\\nTake 6 rounds of bread ¾ inch thick and about the size of a five\\r\\nshilling piece, fry them a golden brown colour, sprinkle over them\\r\\na dust of dry mustard, a layer of grated cheese, salt and pepper to\\r\\ntaste. Place them in a quick oven until the cheese is cooked, then\\r\\nplace a spoonful of hot rice on each, garnish with capers and serve\\r\\nvery hot.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCheese Canapés (Cold)\\r\\n\\r\\nGrate 2 oz. of cheese and mix it smoothly in a basin with a\\r\\ndessertspoonful of mustard, the same of anchovy sauce, a shake of\\r\\ncayenne, a pinch of salt, a dessertspoonful of anchovy vinegar, a\\r\\ntablespoonful of fresh butter and the yolks of 2 hard-boiled eggs. Mix\\r\\nthis until it is a smooth paste, then spread it on rounds of buttered\\r\\nwhite or brown bread. Chop the whites of the eggs finely or press them\\r\\nthrough a sieve on to the paste. Serve cold.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLittle Cheese Custards (Hot)\\r\\n\\r\\nGrate finely 3½ oz. of cheese and mix it with 1 egg, add ¼ pint of\\r\\nboiling milk, pour the mixture into small fireproof dishes and bake for\\r\\n10 to 15 minutes. Serve hot in the dishes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCheese Patties (Hot)\\r\\n\\r\\nLine the required number of patty pans with puff pastry. Boil 1 oz.\\r\\nof macaroni in just as much water as it will absorb. When soft cut it\\r\\ninto tiny pieces, mix with it 1 oz. of finely-grated cheese, a pinch of\\r\\nsalt, a pinch of cayenne, and bind the mixture with a little cream or\\r\\ncheese sauce. Bake for 10 minutes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTomato Cheese Croûtons (Hot)\\r\\n\\r\\nStew ½ lb. of tomatoes in butter until tender with onion cut up finely,\\r\\nput them through a sieve, adding a small quantity of cream, or milk if\\r\\nthe former is not procurable. Replace the tomato in the pan and add\\r\\nto it enough grated cheese to make it like a thick cream, season with\\r\\npepper and place a little of the mixture in croûtons of fried bread.\\r\\nServe very hot.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCream of Cheese\\r\\n\\r\\nMake some squares of hot buttered toast, place on a hot dish and keep\\r\\nhot. Melt ½ lb. of cheese in a little saucepan with 1 oz. of butter\\r\\nand 3 tablespoonsful of cream (or milk), pepper and salt. When of the\\r\\nconsistency of very thick custard pour it over the toast and serve.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the following Cheese Dishes, _see 10s. a Head for House Books_:--\\r\\n\\r\\nCheese Balls, Biscuits (hot or cold), Creams, Croûstades, Croûtons, Egg\\r\\nToast, Pastry, Pudding, Ramekins, Straws.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n_The Single-Handed Cook:--_\\r\\n\\r\\nCheese and Potato Fritters, Cream Croûtons, Cream Tartlets, Custard,\\r\\nFingers, Pufflets, Quenelles, Soufflé, Tartlets, Zephyrs.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER VII\\r\\n\\r\\nOMELETTES AND CURRIES\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOmelette\\r\\n\\r\\nBreak two eggs into a basin, season with salt, pepper, minced parsley,\\r\\nand chives, etc., and beat these all together for about 1 minute. Melt\\r\\n1 oz. of butter in an absolutely clean pan (it is best to keep a pan\\r\\non purpose for omelettes), and when this smokes, pour in the eggs, and\\r\\ndo not touch them for a few seconds, till the liquid has set a little\\r\\nat the bottom of the pan; tilt the pan a trifle to one side, and if\\r\\nthere is a small puff of steam, lift the edge up carefully with a knife\\r\\nto allow as much of the liquid as possible to run underneath; repeat\\r\\nthis till there is no more egg liquid left, and the top just set,\\r\\nslip a knife under the omelette, fold it over, and slip it at once on\\r\\nto a hot dish, and serve immediately. This can be varied, of course,\\r\\nto any extent, by, just before folding it over, slipping in any kind\\r\\nof vegetable mixture, such as mushrooms, chopped up and previously\\r\\nlightly fried in a little butter.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPotato Omelette\\r\\n\\r\\nTo 4 eggs add 2 tablespoonsful of very smoothly mashed potato, add a\\r\\ntablespoonful of cream, a small piece of butter, pepper and salt, whip\\r\\nall together and then fry as before.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nGreen Pea Omelette\\r\\n\\r\\nPlace between the omelette a few green peas, made very hot, and tossed\\r\\nin butter, salt and pepper.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAsparagus Omelette\\r\\n\\r\\nFold the omelette over a few cooked asparagus tops, which have been\\r\\nmade hot.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTomato Omelette\\r\\n\\r\\nMake an ordinary omelette, and before serving pour this mixture into\\r\\nit. Take two or three tomatoes and cut them into pieces, cut an onion\\r\\ninto very thin slices, melt a tablespoonful of butter into a saucepan\\r\\nand place the onion in it. Cook them, but do not brown, add pepper,\\r\\nsalt and the pieces of tomato. Stir all together for 10 minutes,\\r\\ntake out the mixture, pass it through a sieve, and return to the pan,\\r\\nthoroughly reheat and it is ready for use.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCheese Omelette\\r\\n\\r\\nAdd an heaped-up tablespoonful of grated cheese to the ordinary\\r\\nomelette mixture, sprinkling some over it just before serving.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFrench Bean Omelette\\r\\n\\r\\nHeat some cooked French beans in butter and place them between a plain\\r\\nomelette.\\r\\n\\r\\nRecipes for omelette made with flour, anchovy, cheese, mushroom, and\\r\\nsardine omelettes will be found in _Savouries Simplified_, by Mrs. C.\\r\\nS. Peel.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSome Maigre Curries\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are, of course, many varieties of curry. The recipe for one\\r\\nof worth is given in my _10s. a Head Cookery Book_, and I here add\\r\\nanother, but before giving detailed recipes let us deal with the broad\\r\\nrules for curry making, the most important of all being--\\r\\n\\r\\nDo not attempt to make curry in a hurry.\\r\\n\\r\\n2 hours is the least in which you can make a vegetable curry worthy of\\r\\nthe name, and it is far wiser to allow 3 or 4 hours.\\r\\n\\r\\nDo not ask your cook to make curry on a day when she is very busy with\\r\\nother matters, for it will take an hour or more of undivided attention\\r\\nas well as a certain amount of attention throughout the time of cooking.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is, however, no reason that curry should not be made the day\\r\\nbefore it is wanted, for it improves by keeping, and by being reheated.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA Delicious Vegetable Curry\\r\\n\\r\\nWeigh 5 oz. of butter (or if economy must be studied, 3 oz. of\\r\\nclarified dripping, and 2 oz. of butter). Choose four medium-sized\\r\\nonions, and chop them very fine. Melt the butter in a stewpan and\\r\\nadd the onions and cook them until they are of a deep golden brown,\\r\\nstirring often. Meanwhile, put 1 tablespoonful of curry powder in a\\r\\nsaucer in the oven for 10 minutes, then mix it to a smooth paste with\\r\\na little cream, or if this cannot be allowed, some milk, and add it to\\r\\nthe onion mixture, and stir well. Cook slowly, stirring frequently for\\r\\n2 hours in all. During this time the onions will become quite pulpy,\\r\\nand the butter like oil, and the colour of the mixture will slowly\\r\\ndeepen to a rich mustard yellow. While this “ghee,” as it is called, is\\r\\ncooking, take 1 small vegetable marrow, cut in squares; ½ lb. of French\\r\\nbeans, strung and broken in half; 2 large tomatoes, quartered; ½ a\\r\\nsmall cucumber, peeled and sliced; 1 small apple, peeled and cored and\\r\\nsliced; ½ a small carrot, sliced. Boil the vegetables as usual, cooking\\r\\nthe larger and firmer longer than those of a more delicate kind. Make\\r\\nthe curry mixture given above, and add the vegetables during the last ½\\r\\nhour of cooking. Serve with a border of rice.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis recipe does not make a sloppy curry, but one in which the solid\\r\\ningredients are coated with the thick sauce.\\r\\n\\r\\nOther dishes, not properly curries though flavoured with curry powder,\\r\\nare often termed curry. They provide a quick and easy method of serving\\r\\nvarious materials. For these a curry sauce is needed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCurry Sauce\\r\\n\\r\\nChop an onion and a few slices of apple finely and fry them in 2 oz.\\r\\nof clarified dripping or butter. Stir in ½ a dessertspoonful of curry\\r\\npowder and the same of flour. Salt to taste. Add ¼ pint of stock or\\r\\nmilk, cook gently for 30 minutes, then put all through a sieve, add a\\r\\nfew drops of lemon juice, and reheat.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCurried Cabbage\\r\\n\\r\\nTake all the outer leaves off a young cabbage and boil it until it\\r\\nis half cooked. Drain it and chop it finely, place it in a pan with\\r\\nsome curry sauce and simmer it gently for 1 hour. Serve in a border of\\r\\nboiled rice.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCurried Potatoes\\r\\n\\r\\nSlice some hot boiled potatoes and pour over them a curry sauce.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCurried Macaroni\\r\\n\\r\\nBoil the quantity of macaroni required until tender, drain it and cut\\r\\nit into pieces 1 inch in length. Place it in the curry sauce already\\r\\ndescribed for 10 minutes, and serve in a rice border.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLentil Curry\\r\\n\\r\\nTake the cooked lentils (_see_ page 47) and heat them in curry sauce.\\r\\nServe very hot in a border of rice.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHaricot Bean Curry\\r\\n\\r\\nProceed as for Lentil Curry.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER VIII\\r\\n\\r\\nSALADS\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe English salad is not as a rule a success, and undoubtedly the chief\\r\\nfault in its making lies in the inferior quality of the oil used.\\r\\n\\r\\nProvided with good oil the next point of importance in a green salad\\r\\nis the condition of the material. If the lettuces, endive, cress or\\r\\nwatercress are faded the salad is ruined. The lettuce, etc., should\\r\\nof course be freshly cut, if possible, but where this is not feasible\\r\\nit should be chosen with care, and at once put into water--not soused\\r\\ninto a basin, but placed with its root only in water--as if it were a\\r\\nflower--in a cool place. In this way a lettuce will keep in perfect\\r\\ncondition for two or three days, if needs be. Cress and endive should\\r\\nbe treated likewise. Let us now consider the making of\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFrench Salad\\r\\n\\r\\nChoose crisp lettuces, cut off the stalk and remove the outer leaves\\r\\n(when well washed these may be used for lettuce purée), tear the\\r\\nlettuce in pieces (on no account cut it), and wash it in a bowl of\\r\\ncold water. Place it in a clean cloth and swing it round until dry.\\r\\nThis method of drying by centrifugal force gets rid of the moisture and\\r\\ndoes not bruise the lettuce.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow rub the salad bowl very thoroughly with a slice of onion, and if\\r\\nthe flavour is liked place half a small peeled onion in the centre of\\r\\nthe bowl. Mix in the bowl 1 dessertspoonful of the best wine vinegar\\r\\nand 2 tablespoonsful of oil, and add a little salt and a good dusting\\r\\nof freshly-ground black pepper. Stir the lettuce round lightly in the\\r\\nmixture and serve. This quantity of oil and vinegar is sufficient for\\r\\nabout 2 medium lettuces, but only experience teaches the exact quantity\\r\\nto use. The lettuce should not be swimming in the mixture: the leaves\\r\\nshould merely be coated with it, and no remains of it should be left at\\r\\nthe bottom of the bowl when the salad is mixed.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe chief faults of the average salad, next to the use of inferior oil\\r\\nand flabby lettuce, are the excess of dressing, the excess of vinegar,\\r\\nand the use of pepper which is not freshly ground. A salad prepared in\\r\\nthe manner described is as different as chalk is from cheese from the\\r\\nsalad which is generally put before one, and no more difficult to make.\\r\\nSalads of endive, corn, Batavian lettuce, or cress, should be made in\\r\\njust the same manner.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor orange salad and orange and cherry salad a similar dressing is\\r\\nused, and I notice how these fruit salads are growing in favour.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOrange Salad\\r\\n\\r\\nsimply consists of the sections of oranges free from pith and skin,\\r\\nstring and pips, arranged in a bowl and dressed with oil and vinegar.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOrange and Cherry Salad\\r\\n\\r\\nconsists of glacé cherries arranged in the centre of the bowl\\r\\nsurrounded by sections of oranges, and dressed with the same mixture.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother excellent salad, not very generally known, consists of sliced\\r\\napple and shred celery; it is known as\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nApple and Celery Salad,\\r\\n\\r\\nand is dressed with mayonnaise sauce, or with whipped cream flavoured\\r\\nwith salt and pepper. This\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCream Dressing\\r\\n\\r\\nis newer than mayonnaise, and is generally appreciated. Another\\r\\ndelicious salad on which it is used is\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNut Salad\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is made of Brazil nuts broken into pieces, shred celery, and tiny\\r\\ndice of bread and butter. This salad is equally good if dressed with\\r\\ncream or with mayonnaise sauce.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs mayonnaise is generally spoiled by too overpowering a use of\\r\\nvinegar, I give here an excellent recipe in which the special oil and\\r\\nvinegar already mentioned are employed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nGood Mayonnaise Sauce\\r\\n\\r\\nTo make mayonnaise sauce, first rinse the basin in very cold water, and\\r\\nmake the sauce in a cool place, if possible keeping the basin on ice\\r\\nwhile you mix the sauce. See that the oil is perfectly good, and add\\r\\nit drop by drop. This is important, otherwise the sauce may curdle.\\r\\nUse the very best vinegar, as a very little of this will suffice and\\r\\nprevent the sauce from becoming thin. Put the yolks of 2 raw eggs in\\r\\na basin, and add to them a pinch of salt, ½ a saltspoonful of white\\r\\npepper, and ½ a teaspoonful of French and English mustard in the dry\\r\\nstate, and a tiny pinch of cayenne. Work these together, then stir in\\r\\ndrop by drop 3 gills of olive oil. When quite thick add ½ a teaspoonful\\r\\nof lemon juice, and 2 dessertspoonsful of the best vinegar drop by\\r\\ndrop, and set in a cool place, or on ice, until required. In case\\r\\nthe sauce curdles the yolk of another egg must be beaten up, and the\\r\\ncurdled sauce added to it little by little.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOil and Vinegar Dressing\\r\\n\\r\\nMix 1 saltspoonful of salt and a good pinch of black pepper with 1\\r\\ntablespoonful of tarragon vinegar. Stir until the salt has dissolved,\\r\\nthen add drop by drop 3 tablespoonsful of olive oil.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe other dressings generally used are sauce tartare, salad dressing\\r\\nand sauce vinaigrette, for which I give the following excellent\\r\\nrecipes:--\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSauce Tartare\\r\\n\\r\\nChop 1 shallot very fine, with ½ a tablespoonful of chervil, the same\\r\\nof tarragon, and 12 capers, also finely minced. Place these ingredients\\r\\nin a bowl and add ½ a teaspoonful of mustard powder (English), the\\r\\nyolks of 2 raw eggs, and drop by drop 1 teaspoonful of vinegar; then\\r\\na pinch of salt and ⅓ the quantity of pepper. Pour in by degrees,\\r\\nstirring all the time, a teacupful of oil. If too thick add drop by\\r\\ndrop a little more vinegar, and if too salt a little more mustard and\\r\\noil.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSalad Dressing\\r\\n\\r\\nBeat the hard-boiled yolk of 2 eggs with 1 teaspoonful of dry mustard.\\r\\nWhen smooth add by slow degrees 8 dessertspoonsful of oil, 5 of\\r\\nvinegar, 1½ of sugar, and ½ a teacupful of cream. Beat together with a\\r\\nsilver spoon until smooth. If bottled this dressing will keep for some\\r\\ndays.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSauce Vinaigrette\\r\\n\\r\\nMince very finely 1 shallot, 2 good sprigs of parsley and the same\\r\\nquantity of chervil and chives. Place with them about 1 tablespoonful\\r\\nof salt, 1 teaspoonful of fresh black pepper and 3 tablespoonsful of\\r\\nvinegar. Stir well together, add by degrees, stirring all the time, 4\\r\\ntablespoonsful of oil.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn salads where chives, onion or garlic are mentioned, it is best,\\r\\nunless the taste of those about to partake of the dish is known, to\\r\\nomit them, and either to rub the salad bowl with onion or garlic or to\\r\\nprepare what is called a chapon:--\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapon\\r\\n\\r\\nCut a neat square of crust from a French loaf, sprinkle it with salt\\r\\nand rub it with raw onion or with a clove of garlic. Put this at the\\r\\nbottom of the salad bowl, place the salad on it and mix thoroughly.\\r\\nServe immediately.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nVegetable Marrow Salad\\r\\n\\r\\nBoil or steam the marrow, drain, and when cold cut into neat pieces,\\r\\nplace in a salad bowl with a dressing of oil and vinegar.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nArtichoke Salad\\r\\n\\r\\nBoil the number of Japanese artichokes required for 5 minutes, and when\\r\\ncold place in a salad bowl with slices of cold boiled beetroot and\\r\\ncelery. Cover with mayonnaise sauce. Garnish with beetroot and celery.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFrench Bean Salad\\r\\n\\r\\nBoil the beans whole, drain them, and dry them on a cloth, when quite\\r\\ncold place them in a bowl and pour over them some salad oil, shake some\\r\\nblack pepper over them and a small amount of salt, then drop over them\\r\\na few drops of the best wine vinegar, and if liked a sprinkling of very\\r\\nfinely-minced tarragon and chives.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLettuce Stalk Salad\\r\\n\\r\\nTake the stalks from lettuces running to seed, and tie them in bundles,\\r\\ncutting them more or less the same size. Place in a saucepan and boil\\r\\nuntil tender, 10 to 15 minutes. Take out and drain them, and allow\\r\\nthem to get quite cold. Then cut up into slices of the same size, place\\r\\nin a salad bowl and cover with mayonnaise sauce.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNut and Celery Salad\\r\\n\\r\\nCrack some Brazil nuts and cut the kernels into 3 or 4 pieces. Take an\\r\\nequal quantity of crisp cleanly-washed and shred celery. Mix together\\r\\nand dress with mayonnaise sauce. Pile in the centre of the salad bowl\\r\\nand garnish with sliced tomato or beetroot.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWinter Salad\\r\\n\\r\\nScald and then boil one or two large onions till soft. When cold, slice\\r\\nthe onion, mix it with shred celery and sliced beetroot. Dress with\\r\\noil, vinegar, salt and pepper.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWalnut and Celery Salad,\\r\\n\\r\\nwhich is simply ⅔ celery to ⅓ walnuts tossed in mayonnaise sauce.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nRussian Salad, No. 1\\r\\n\\r\\nCut up some beetroot into shapes, add to this a little chopped celery,\\r\\nsome turnip, carrot, potato, all cooked and cut into dice; pour some\\r\\nmayonnaise over it all, mix well, and garnish with bunches of cress.\\r\\nIf liked, a French vinaigrette dressing may be used instead of the\\r\\nmayonnaise.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nRussian Salad, No. 2\\r\\n\\r\\nCut in thin slices a few small cold steamed potatoes, 1 small beetroot\\r\\nboiled, 1 small carrot, a few cold peas or French beans, 1 little\\r\\npickled cabbage, 1 sardine filleted and chopped fine. Mix all well\\r\\ntogether. Rub the salad bowl with onion. For the dressing take a\\r\\nteaspoonful each of raw mustard and salt, a little coralline pepper, a\\r\\npinch of curry powder, ½ a wineglass of sherry and the same of Lucca\\r\\noil. Mix all well together and pour over the salad.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHaricot Bean Salad\\r\\n\\r\\nSoak the haricots for 6 or 8 hours and then boil them until tender.\\r\\nLeave until cold. Pile them in the centre of a salad bowl and surround\\r\\nwith shred tomato or beetroot and some shred celery. Cover with whipped\\r\\ncream flavoured with salt and white pepper. If liked dip the haricot\\r\\nin oil and vinegar in addition to the cream. Decorate the cream with a\\r\\nlittle coralline pepper, and arrange the beetroot so that it makes a\\r\\nred border to the white pyramid of cream.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSalade d’Estrées\\r\\n\\r\\nTake some cold boiled roots of celeriac, some cold potatoes and\\r\\nbeetroot. In the middle of the salad bowl make a heap of endive and\\r\\nblanched celery stalks, frizzed, in short lengths. Surround with the\\r\\nvegetables sliced. Pour over the whole a good mayonnaise sauce.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nGarnished Salad, with Imperial Mayonnaise\\r\\n\\r\\nPound and press through a sieve 4 large anchovies (no bones), boil 6\\r\\neggs hard, halve them and neatly remove the yolks, which pound to a\\r\\npaste with butter, the powdered anchovies, ¼ teaspoonful of mace, a\\r\\nlittle pepper. Mix well, and roughly fill the egg cases. Fill almost\\r\\nto the top the salad bowl with finely-shred lettuce, endive, cooked\\r\\nbeetroot, sliced (very thin) artichoke (cooked), and finally add some\\r\\ncucumber ribbons. Then arrange with care the egg baskets and pour\\r\\nround, but not over the halved eggs, the following dressing (imperial\\r\\nmayonnaise):--Put into a basin ½ pint of aspic, and add 1 tablespoonful\\r\\nof olive oil, 2 teaspoonsful of vinegar, and a trifle of salt and\\r\\npepper. Beat with an egg whisk until all the ingredients are well\\r\\nblended. Set the salad in a pan of ice water if possible, or in a very\\r\\ncold place until served.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCelery Salad\\r\\n\\r\\nWash some fresh crisp celery and use only the inner sticks. Cut it in\\r\\n½ inch lengths, place in a salad bowl which has been rubbed with onion\\r\\nand dress with mayonnaise sauce. Decorate with a little chopped truffle.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSalade d’Asperges à la d’Aumale\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is a way of using cold cooked asparagus with mousseline sauce. Put\\r\\n½ gill of new milk into a pan with the yolks of 4 eggs, and 3 crushed\\r\\nlong peppercorns; place this all in a bainmarie, or larger stewpan,\\r\\nhalf filled with boiling water, and whisk it all together well for a\\r\\nfew minutes; now add 1 oz. of butter, adding it bit by bit, and only\\r\\nputting in another piece when the first is thoroughly melted and worked\\r\\nin. Season it as you whisk with a dust of salt and nutmeg, and a tiny\\r\\nsqueeze of lemon juice at the last. When it is finished this sauce\\r\\nshould look like frothed cream.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother salad which is suitable for hot weather is\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLettuce and Tomato Salad\\r\\n\\r\\nFor this proceed exactly as for a plain lettuce salad, but add a ring\\r\\nof fresh tomato, peeled, and not too thinly sliced.\\r\\n\\r\\nOther nice salads are--\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFrench Tomato Salad\\r\\n\\r\\nTake 6 ripe, sound tomatoes, wipe them, and place them in boiling water\\r\\nfor a minute; drain, peel, let them cool, quarter them (this should\\r\\nbe done while they are in the salad bowl, so that the juice is not\\r\\nwasted); add a teaspoonful of finely-chopped chives or a chapon; dress\\r\\nwith oil and vinegar.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTomato and Egg Salad\\r\\n\\r\\nProceed as before, but to each tomato add ½ a hard-boiled egg,\\r\\nquartered, and dress with mayonnaise sauce.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the following salads _see_\\r\\n\\r\\n_10s. a Head for Housebooks._\\r\\n\\r\\n  Green Pea.\\r\\n

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™\\r\\n\\r\\nProject Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of\\r\\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\\r\\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\\r\\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\\r\\nfrom people in all walks of life.\\r\\n\\r\\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\\r\\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s\\r\\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will\\r\\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\\r\\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\\r\\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future\\r\\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\\r\\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\\r\\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.\\r\\n\\r\\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit\\r\\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\\r\\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\\r\\nRevenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification\\r\\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\\r\\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\\r\\nU.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Foundation’s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,\\r\\nSalt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up\\r\\nto date contact information can be found at the Foundation’s website\\r\\nand official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact\\r\\n\\r\\nSection 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\\r\\nLiterary Archive Foundation\\r\\n\\r\\nProject Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread\\r\\npublic support and donations to carry out its mission of\\r\\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\\r\\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\\r\\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\\r\\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\\r\\nstatus with the IRS.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\\r\\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\\r\\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\\r\\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\\r\\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\\r\\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\\r\\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state\\r\\nvisit www.gutenberg.org/donate.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\\r\\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\\r\\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\\r\\napproach us with offers to donate.\\r\\n\\r\\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\\r\\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\\r\\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\\r\\n\\r\\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\\r\\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\\r\\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\\r\\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.\\r\\n\\r\\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works\\r\\n\\r\\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\\r\\nGutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be\\r\\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\\r\\ndistributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of\\r\\nvolunteer support.\\r\\n\\r\\nProject Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed\\r\\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\\r\\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\\r\\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\\r\\nedition.\\r\\n\\r\\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\\r\\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,\\r\\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\\r\\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\\r\\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n']\n","260\n"]},{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["
